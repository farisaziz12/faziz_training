    With a decade of experience in dealing with personal debilitating health
    issues ranging from an auto-immune condition to obesity I have developed a
    keen understanding of the human body. Faced with these challenges I decided
    to take it upon myself to light the path to my recovery. In doing so I
    endeavoured into educating myself about all aspects of fitness and health
    from nutrition to a multitude of training methodologies. With a passion for
    for helping others I seek to aid anyone's journey to self improvement and
    enhance their quality of life through the practice of fitness. In the
    process of this I have gained an extensive amount of experience in{" "}
